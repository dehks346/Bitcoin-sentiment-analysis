<h1><strong>Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis Tool</strong></h1>

<p>Developed a Bitcoin sentiment analysis tool that scrapes daily news articles containing Bitcoin-related keywords from Google News. Headlines are stored in a database and processed using natural language processing libraries (VADER and TextBlob) to generate sentiment scores. An average sentiment score is computed for each article and aggregated daily. These sentiment trends are then plotted in real-time alongside live Bitcoin price data, with significant sentiment shifts highlighted on the graph. The system continuously updates and stores both sentiment and market data for historical analysis and correlation insights.</p>
